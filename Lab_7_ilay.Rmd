```{r}
mwu_kermit <-kermit %>%
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender,data= .)

# null : ther e is not a significant difference in ranks for male and female respondents

# alternative : there IS a significant difference in ranks

mwu_kermit

#retain null j
```

There was no significant difference in ranks for male and female respondents (W= 155.5, p= 0.4, alpha = 0.05)


Is there a siginificant change in Kermit rankings before and after his Bren talks?
